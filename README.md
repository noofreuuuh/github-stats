## 👋 Hi there
I'm *Sebastien Le Mouillour* (aka. [Noofreuuuh].

I have been a developer since 2007, firstly on the backend side (Java) and since 2015 on the frontend side (React).

I worked for Sopra Steria, Infotel and now for Talend.

Here, you are in my personal GitHub account, but you will not find any project 🫢.

## 💍 One organization to rule them all
You can retrieve all my projects in the Github organisation [*grasdouble*](https://github.com/grasdouble).

I created it to be able to: 
- test Github organisation,
- not have to switch between my pro and personal github account to commit something
- facilitate work with others on projects.

## 🧑🏻‍💻 What about professional activities
